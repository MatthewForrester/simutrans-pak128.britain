# CALIBRATED: see http://www.traintesting.com/bulletin_1.htm
# Max. speed given as 47mph with a train of 582t (gross)
# Adjusting for rising gradient of 1/834 (+14Kw)
# NOTE: The source itself suggests drawbar horsepower at approx. 550hp,
# which is equivalent to 410.1Kw, compared to the 338Kw suggested
# by in-game tests adjusted for by gradient. That is to be preferred
# given the better efficiency given.
